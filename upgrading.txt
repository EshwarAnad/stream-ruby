2.0.1 Changed signature to initialise Feeds and for follow / unfollow feeds.

. Stream::Feed and Stream::Client#feed signatures changed; the feed_id argument (eg. 'user:1') is not split in the feed_slug and user_id arguments ('user', '1')
. Stream::Feed#follow and Stream::Feed#unfollow signature changed (see line above)
